           A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae,or the flower it bears.There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.
           They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often 
           armed with sharp prickles.[1] Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, 
           in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.[1] Most species are native to Asia, 
           with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.[1] Species, 
           cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. 
           Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies.[1] Rose plants range in size from compact,
           miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily,
           and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses 
           The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. 
           Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not
           provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. Rosa pimpinellifolia) 
           have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 
          "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (Rosa canina) and rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), are very rich in vitamin C, 
           among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. 
           Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip.

           The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed
           straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points. </div>
